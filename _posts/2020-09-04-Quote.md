“Speech is power: speech is to persuade, to convert, to compel.”
— Ralph Waldo Emerson, an American essayist and lecturer
As we are getting ready to celebrate the life and legacy of Periyar Ayya, on his 145th birthday, we think it would be very fitting for our youth to engage in a heartfelt rhetorical session learning about what turned a common man EVR into “Periyar” indeed. Our intent is to encourage inquisitive young minds to reason, rationalize and fearlessly ask questions especially when something does not connect with the intellect… just the way Periyar did.   In an effort to follow in his footsteps and pave the way for more “Periyars” in-the-making, let’s get the word out about few Youth events to reel in more participants!
