Honoring September as Dravidian History Month… **Lets celebrate Periyar!** - The social revolutionary icon’s 145th birth anniversary. As beneficiaries, we are enjoying the fruits of his labor – due to his hard fought battle against social injustice, we have come a long way. Our participation in this celebratory event is our way of giving thanks to him & his priceless service to humanity. Indeed the best way, would be to uphold the values he stood for - to join in the fight to establish a new egalitarian society… devoid of discrimination and dehumanization, to annihilate the caste system and totally eradicate discrimination by birth in any form. To state in simple terms...<br/>**Liberty, Equality & Fraternity!!!**
