Lets celebrate Periyar 145 - the social revolutionary icon’s 145th birth anniversary.  Sep. is super special month that calls for celebration, Why? Remembering Dravidian History Month – as beneficiaries of his hard fought battle we are enjoying the fruits of his labor – the hard fought battle against social injustice – we have come a long way – our presence today is our way of giving thanks to him  - but the best way would be to uphold the values he stood for -  to establish a new egalitarian society, devoid of discrimination and dehumanization -  to annihilate the caste system and totally eradicate discrimination by birth in any form. To state it in simple terms, Liberty, Equality & Fraternity!!!
