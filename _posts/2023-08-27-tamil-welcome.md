<strong>Thanthai Periyar</strong> – the father of Modern Dravidian movement – a true visionary who propounded rationalism, a fierce leader who defied all odds, a leader without borders and boundaries dedicated his entire life to the fight against inequality and social injustice in striving to establish an egalitarian society. To eradicate Casteism in Indian society following the dictates of the Hindu religion where people are enslaved based on discrimination at birth.   Indian Caste system earmarked at birth was dictated and cleverly manipulated by the Hindu religious doctrine which sets a top-down social structure of oppression that differentiates individuals based on birth and social standing.

Lets celebrate Periyar 145 - the social revolutionary icon’s 143 birth anniversary.  Sep. is super special month that calls for celebration, Why? Remembering Dravidian History Month – as beneficiaries of his hard fought battle we are enjoying the fruits of his labor – the hard fought battle against social injustice – we have come a long way – our presence today is our way of giving thanks to him  - but the best way would be to uphold the values he stood for -  to establish a new egalitarian society, devoid of discrimination and dehumanization -  to annihilate the caste system and totally eradicate discrimination by birth in any form. To state it in simple terms, Liberty, Equality & Fraternity!!!

Last year, we successfully engaged 120 students in a speech competition about Periyar & his legacy as a dauntless warrior and social justice stalwart and kids spoke eloquently about why the need for Periyar  exists even today. This year, we would like to give it a creative spin – by hosting events to help you showcase your talent – be it acting, poetry, essay writing or drawing. Something different but our baseline still remains the same – Remembering Periyar who spent his entire life to uplift the down & depressed and being the torchbearers of his Social Justice and Equality idelologies/philosophy!
