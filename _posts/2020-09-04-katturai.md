Let your creative juices flow from your pen to paper. Periyar 145 celebratory event encourages you to bring out the writer in you. It’s your chance to affect others thru your words – create an impact coz. written words are stronger and possess great emphasis compared to spoken words… coz writing gives more subtle yet solid messages. Your theme-based writing on topics presented on Periyar & social justice (the societal challenges and injustices we still see today around us), equality and humanism would help foster not only an awareness but potentially make a difference esp. among your peers and the general population.  


> Your essay will be published in Periyar Pinju magazine in Tamilnadu, India with a wider reach of thousands of readers.
