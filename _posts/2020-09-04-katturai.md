## Let Your Words Make an Impact

Let your creative juices flow from your pen to paper. The Periyar 145 celebratory event encourages you to bring out the writer in you. This is your chance to influence others through your words, as written words hold stronger emphasis compared to spoken words. Writing allows for subtler yet more impactful messages. Your theme-based writing on topics related to Periyar, social justice, equality, and humanism can raise awareness and potentially create a difference, especially among your peers and the wider population.
